His face clearly expresses the extreme effort required to transport the infant Christ across the river. A hermit stands with a lantern on the shore in the right background. The electoral coats of arms suspended from the boughs at the upper left suggest that the woodcut was commissioned by Friedrich III the Wise.\nThe block was initially dated 1506, cut in the line block, but this date was later removed, corresponding with the second state. Competition between Cranach and his contemporaries led to the development of the chiaroscuro woodcut, a tonal block, which simulated heightening by leaving parts of the paper white and it may have prompted him to deliberately antedate the first state by two years. Certain other arguments also cast doubt on the date. Cranach was not entitled to use the coat of arms with a serpent, seen on this print, until 1508 when it was granted to him by Duke Friedrich and in fact, it is not displayed on any other print before 1509. The most likely sequence of events was that Cranach learnt of the advances made in Augsburg on the invention of the tone block soon after his return from the Netherlands in 1508, and then produced his own version in the 'St Christopher' and 'Venus' woodcuts around 1509.\n\n1st state [Dodgson 1911, 295-296, 61a-c] [Hollstein 56.79]:\na. with the date 1506.

Small objects of Italian Renaissance metalware were much sought after by the intellectual élite, such as Friedrich's chancellor, Degenhart Pfeffinger (1471-1519), and the main part of this composition was inspired by a bronze of this type (possibly one attributed to Giovanni delle Opere or delle Corniole).

Upon a shield supported by four flying angels is displayed a heart, surmounted by flames confined within a crown. A crucifix is framed within the heart; a scroll with or without text (depending on the state of the impression) passes in front of the stem of the cross; descending flames form a pattern upon the right side of the heart. Beneath the shield is a landscape, containing a view of a castle surrounded by a deer park. In the foreground are two pairs of kneeling saints: the Virgin and St John at the centre, with St Sebastian and St Roche behind them. Their presence indicates that the print was associated with protection from the plague.\nThe date 1505 is placed, within the monogram, beneath St John, and the two coats of arms of Saxony occupy the lower corners, the electoral on the left, the ducal on the right. These shields denoting Cranach's official appointment make their first appearance here. The electoral shield with the two crossed swords has the earlier form, in which the lower half of the field is sable, the upper argent, while the ducal shield is shown with three leaves rather than the later five. This arrangement was reversed in the year 1507 or 1508, and many of Cranach's woodcuts were then altered. However, in this case the original shield remains unaltered even in late impressions and subsequent states. \nIn one state the scroll was empty and in another bears the inscription 'VIRGO MATER MARIA'.

The complex design of this print contains numerous combatants on horseback jousting with lances in a square surrounded by buildings; the knight in the lower right corner with the letter 'A' ('Altösterreich'?) on his caparison is seen in other prints and possibly represents the Emperor Maximilian.

This woodcut was commissioned by Friedrich III of Saxony together with the accompanying image of Hell. The elector is shown kneeling at the bottom of the ladder, while the Saxon shields are represented in the upper corners. Below the woodcut depicts two groups of men and women representing the church militant with a devil on either side. A ladder reaches at centre from the earth up to heaven, with the Holy Trinity at its head, in two circles, supported by the symbols of the Evangelists. On either side there is a group of Holy men and women, and several putti hover above. Numerous scrolls with text reveal that the image is a reference to St Bonaventura, who described the way to God using the metaphor of a celestial ladder. Cranach's image is a simplified representation of 'Itinerarium mentis in Deum', published in 1269. Here instead of the seven steps listed by Bonaventura only three are shown. \nThese bear inscriptions, printed in Gothic type.

Two editions are known (a third one was probably planned, but never completed). The first edition was published in 1509 with 108 woodcuts by Lucas Cranach the Elder, showing reliquaries and treasures in the church of All Saints. The second edition contains a set of 119 woodcuts. This engraving served as the title-page to the second edition of the Wittenberg Heiligthumsbuch with an impression of Cranach's woodcut of the church of All Saints printed on the verso (Hollstein, 96). The title of the book 'Dye zaigung des hochlobwirdi= // gen hailigthumbs der Stifft // kirchen aller hailigen zu // wittenburg' was printed on the sheet above the image in letterpress. The engraving was also issued in a separate edition in which the versos are blank. \nThe image shows Elector Friedrich the Wise who ruled Saxony jointly with his brother, Duke Johann the Constant (1468-1532). They are set in a niche behind a ballustrade. Friedrich holds rosary beads in his hands and his gaze is directed piously upwards. Both are dressed in stately attire and the electoral coats of arms decorate the upper corners. Cranach has placed his insignia in a prominent position on a plaque at the centre of the ballustrade. \nTogether the brothers were responsible for enlarging the collection of treasures and relics for the church of All Saints begun by their ancestors. Friedrich later became an active supporter of Martin Luther and the Reformation and was excommunicated by the Pope in 1524.","locations":[],"owner":"","images":{"sizes":{"xs":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":224},"src":"http://lucascranach.org/imageserver/G_AT_A_DG1929-75/01_Overall/G_AT_A_DG1929-75_Overall-002-xs.jpg"},"s":{"dimensions":{"width":300,"height":336},"src":"http://lucascranach.org/imageserver/G_AT_A_DG1929-75/01_Overall/G_AT_A_DG1929-75_Overall-002-s.jpg"},"m":{"dimensions":{"width":800,"height":896},"src":"http://lucascranach.org/imageserver/G_AT_A_DG1929-75/01_Overall/G_AT_A_DG1929-75_Overall-002-m.jpg"},"l":{"dimensions":{"width":1200,"height":1344},"src":"http://lucascranach.org/imageserver/G_AT_A_DG1929-75/01_Overall/G_AT_A_DG1929-75_Overall-002-l.jpg"},"xl":{"dimensions":{"width":1566,"height":1754},"src":"http://lucascranach.org/imageserver/G_AT_A_DG1929-75/01_Overall/G_AT_A_DG1929-75_Overall-002-xl.jpg"}}}},{"categoryId":2,"langCode":"en","involvedPersons":[{"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder"}],"titles":[{"title":"Friedrich the Wise, Elector of Saxony in Adoration of St Bartholomew"}],"objectId":946475,"inventoryNumber":"GWN_LC_HVI-5_4","dating":{"dated":"after 1510","begin":1510,"end":1515},"description":"","locations":[],"owner":"","images":{"sizes":{"xs":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":238},"src":"http://lucascranach.org/imageserver/G_AT_A_DG1929-72/01_Overall/G_AT_A_DG1929-72_Overall-002-xs.jpg"},"s":{"dimensions":{"width":300,"height":356},"src":"http://lucascranach.org/imageserver/G_AT_A_DG1929-72/01_Overall/G_AT_A_DG1929-72_Overall-002-s.jpg"},"m":{"dimensions":{"width":800,"height":950},"src":"http://lucascranach.org/imageserver/G_AT_A_DG1929-72/01_Overall/G_AT_A_DG1929-72_Overall-002-m.jpg"},"l":{"dimensions":{"width":1200,"height":1426},"src":"http://lucascranach.org/imageserver/G_AT_A_DG1929-72/01_Overall/G_AT_A_DG1929-72_Overall-002-l.jpg"},"xl":{"dimensions":{"width":1564,"height":1858},"src":"http://lucascranach.org/imageserver/G_AT_A_DG1929-72/01_Overall/G_AT_A_DG1929-72_Overall-002-xl.jpg"}}}},{"categoryId":2,"langCode":"en","involvedPersons":[{"name":"Lucas Cranach der Ältere"}],"titles":[{"title":"St Augustine in Prayer with Christ as the Man of Sorrows"},{"title":"St Bernard Adoring the Man of Sorrows"}],"objectId":948345,"inventoryNumber":"GWN_LC_HVI-53_77","dating":{"dated":"about 1515 - 1518","begin":1510,"end":1523},"description":"St Augustin adoring the Man of Sorrows; Christ sits left on the lid of his tomb, with the instruments of the Passion; the saint in half-length is situated on the right.

It was the first official portrait of Luther and frequently copied by artists in subsequent years.","locations":[],"owner":"","images":{"sizes":{"xs":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":290},"src":"http://lucascranach.org/imageserver/G_AT_A_DG1929-80/01_Overall/G_AT_A_DG1929-80_Overall-002-xs.jpg"},"s":{"dimensions":{"width":300,"height":435},"src":"http://lucascranach.org/imageserver/G_AT_A_DG1929-80/01_Overall/G_AT_A_DG1929-80_Overall-002-s.jpg"},"m":{"dimensions":{"width":800,"height":1160},"src":"http://lucascranach.org/imageserver/G_AT_A_DG1929-80/01_Overall/G_AT_A_DG1929-80_Overall-002-m.jpg"},"l":{"dimensions":{"width":1200,"height":1739},"src":"http://lucascranach.org/imageserver/G_AT_A_DG1929-80/01_Overall/G_AT_A_DG1929-80_Overall-002-l.jpg"},"xl":{"dimensions":{"width":1397,"height":2025},"src":"http://lucascranach.org/imageserver/G_AT_A_DG1929-80/01_Overall/G_AT_A_DG1929-80_Overall-002-xl.jpg"}}}},{"categoryId":2,"langCode":"en","involvedPersons":[{"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder"}],"titles":[{"title":"Luther in Profile with a Doctor's Cap"}],"objectId":954634,"inventoryNumber":"GWN_LC_HVI-9_8","dating":{"dated":"1521","begin":1516,"end":1526},"description":"Portrait of Martin Luther with doctor's cap of theology.; in profile, turned to the left\nknown in two states:\nI. without the cross-hatching in the background\nII. with hatching","locations":[],"owner":"","images":{"sizes":{"xs":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":277},"src":"http://lucascranach.org/imageserver/G_AT_A_DG1929-81/01_Overall/G_AT_A_DG1929-81_Overall-xs.jpg"},"s":{"dimensions":{"width":300,"height":416},"src":"http://lucascranach.org/imageserver/G_AT_A_DG1929-81/01_Overall/G_AT_A_DG1929-81_Overall-s.jpg"},"m":{"dimensions":{"width":800,"height":1109},"src":"http://lucascranach.org/imageserver/G_AT_A_DG1929-81/01_Overall/G_AT_A_DG1929-81_Overall-m.jpg"},"l":{"dimensions":{"width":1200,"height":1663},"src":"http://lucascranach.org/imageserver/G_AT_A_DG1929-81/01_Overall/G_AT_A_DG1929-81_Overall-l.jpg"},"xl":{"dimensions":{"width":1453,"height":2014},"src":"http://lucascranach.org/imageserver/G_AT_A_DG1929-81/01_Overall/G_AT_A_DG1929-81_Overall-xl.jpg"}}}},{"categoryId":2,"langCode":"en","involvedPersons":[{"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder"}],"titles":[{"title":"Luther as Junker Jörg"}],"objectId":940712,"inventoryNumber":"GWN_LC_HVI-107_132","dating":{"dated":"1522","begin":1517,"end":1527},"description":"This woodcut showing 'Luther as Junker Jörg' was Cranach's  last portrait of Luther in printed form. After leaving Worms on the 26 April, 1521, Luther was arrested near Altenburg on the 4th of May by two masked men (friends) and taken to the Wartburg where he remained in retreat dressed as a knight and letting his beard grow until the 3rd March 1522. During this time he paid a hasty visit to Wittenberg where he remained in complete seclusion seeing only Cranach who recognized him straight away.  Cranach portrayed him with a beard, looking out to the left and this image was to mark his return to the public stage in 1522. It was widely disseminated with at least four different textual variants and continued to be printed until late into the 16th century. The inscription celebrates Luther's return employing the island of Patmos (where St John wrote the Apocalypse) as a metaphor for his time at the Wartburg.","locations":[],"owner":"","images":{"sizes":{"xs":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":324},"src":"http://lucascranach.org/imageserver/G_AT_A_DG1929-242/01_Overall/G_AT_A_DG1929-242_Overall-xs.jpg"},"s":{"dimensions":{"width":300,"height":486},"src":"http://lucascranach.org/imageserver/G_AT_A_DG1929-242/01_Overall/G_AT_A_DG1929-242_Overall-s.jpg"},"m":{"dimensions":{"width":800,"height":1297},"src":"http://lucascranach.org/imageserver/G_AT_A_DG1929-242/01_Overall/G_AT_A_DG1929-242_Overall-m.jpg"},"l":{"dimensions":{"width":1200,"height":1946},"src":"http://lucascranach.org/imageserver/G_AT_A_DG1929-242/01_Overall/G_AT_A_DG1929-242_Overall-l.jpg"},"xl":{"dimensions":{"width":1377,"height":2233},"src":"http://lucascranach.org/imageserver/G_AT_A_DG1929-242/01_Overall/G_AT_A_DG1929-242_Overall-xl.jpg"}}}},{"categoryId":2,"langCode":"en","involvedPersons":[{"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder"}],"titles":[{"title":"St Barbara"}],"objectId":960774,"inventoryNumber":"GWN_LC_HVI-68_92","dating":{"dated":"1519","begin":1519,"end":1519},"description":"St Barbara is shown standing at the centre, turned to the right, holding the chalice.
