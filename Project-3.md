# Project 3

## Tasks

### Testing
- Unit Testing
- E2E Testing
- Testing a pull request before merging

Testing is an important part of software development. Testing reduces the time (in the long term) for building and maintaining a project, and improves the architecture and quality of the code.

### Improvement of algorithms
- line allocation algorithm (timeline)

The line allocation algorithm is currently not functioning perfectly. There is a problem with showing lines (artworks) that only partially belong to the chosen period.

### Custom themes
- setting basic colors

Theme customization allows the user of a web application to choose colors based on their own taste, which makes the interface more user-friendly.

### Saving custom settings in browser
- filtering parameters
- colors

Saving user settings in the browser saves time and hassle of the user, while not greatly complicating the application architecture. The user does not need to select commonly used filtering options, colors and other settings each time the wanderer loads.
